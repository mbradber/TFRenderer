	TreeFrog renderer build notes
=====================================
	- An architecture overview of the project can be found in the RenderingArchitecture.txt file.

	- To build this it is assumed that the user has the June 2010 DirectX SDK installed
		as the project will reference the DXSDK_DIR environment variable.
		
	- This project is also natively developed in Visual Studio 2012, so it will take some rework in order
		to build in an earlier version.
		
	- Windows 7 required / DX 11 capable GPU required.
